Description: 'quicktoolsr' package is developed to ease the data preprocessing
    and postprocessing from the Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code (EFDC) model.
    It is sometimes difficult to change the date to julian date and create the
    necessary format required for the model. This package addresses those
    issues and eases through the processes of creating input files. 'efdcr'
    also allows users to import the output of the EFDC model for creating high
    quality graphs. Please send me an email if you like any new feature to be
    added to this package.
